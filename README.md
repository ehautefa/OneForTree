## The Game

The subject was Tech For Good. The purpose of this collaborative game is to seed trees. Each player is randomly assigned a robot at the beginning of the game.  
The robots can be plowers, pickers, waterers, or fertilizers. And all four roles must take action on a tile to seed a tree.  
The game ends when all the tiles have a tree on them.
